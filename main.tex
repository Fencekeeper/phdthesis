    % How should I organize the thesis? There is publishable and non-publishable
    % material. Moreover, it would be convenient if each publishable result is
    % a chapter in this project
    % with an abstract, introduction and so on, as usual. This chapter should be
    % the main chapter of a part. Then it is possible to supplement the chapter with
    % extra details, formal reasoning, examples and non-examples, etc. However,
    % the chapters that are articles will be long, probably longer than most.
    % Thus they should probably be subdivided into sections. I should test how this
    % can be done, technically. The problem is that I do not yet know which chapters
    % will be the articles. This is maybe a good reason to give the chapters
    % descriptive names for myself, but the chapters should still have numbers
    % that are not related to the subdivision into parts.

	% Behavior of desingularization in the presence of various colimits, properties
	% of the category of non-singular simplicial sets, including the construction
	% of simplicial mappings sets. Formalities regarding reflective subcategories,
	% locally presentable categories, etc.
