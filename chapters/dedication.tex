\chapter{Dedication}

The women in my life have taken care of themselves lately. Of that they are more than capable. However, I hope to be around more from now on. Sofia was kind enough to go swimming with me for three quarters of a year during the most hectic period of my PhD candidacy. This weekly happening renewed my focus and made the workweek brighter. Although she learned how to walk a year and a half ago, she is still dependent on others to prepare her meals. The burden fell on her mother who also prepared most of mine.

Most humble of all thanksgivings is the one I direct towards Anisa. To convey the academic achievements of the PhD candidacy at the level I have managed, would not at all have been possible if she was any less patient. By her grace, I have been allowed to neglect parts of my share of the parenthood and of the household. She, on the other hand, took a larger share herself and furthermore organized the efforts made by the other people in our lives. Things are about to become different.

To have Anisa and Sofia in my life adds to the meaning of the PhD candidacy and has increased the motivation to finish in a good way. I am thankful to them both.
