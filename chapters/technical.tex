\label{ch:technical}

To work with long sequences is an essential part of the machinery of model structures. In \cref{sec:smallness}, we will simply explain how this is the case and furthermore, we will point out that to understand sequences in the category $sSet$, it is enough to understand sequences in $nsSet$. This knowledge is used in \cref{ch:htythy}.

A convenient way of thinking of a simplicial set is that it is glued together from its building blocks, the simplices. In other words, a simplicial set is a colimit over its simplices. For this reason, we will in \cref{sec:formal} point out that a similar and more refined viewpoint is possible for non-singular simplicial sets.

We do take the viewpoint that a simplicial set is a colimit over its simplices in \cref{sec:behavior}. However, the reader may skip \cref{sec:formal} after reading \cref{sec:smallness} and jump to \cref{ch:htythy}. This is because the refinement presented in \cref{sec:formal} is not used in \cref{ch:htythy}. Nevertheless, \cref{sec:formal} fits into the storyline by appearing in \cref{ch:sixth}, or more specifically in \cref{sec:simplexcat}.
